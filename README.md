# A Test Project for Valantis

This is a test project that I prepared using React for the Valantis company.

- The app fetches data from the server using the company's API and shows a list of products.
- Each product has its id, name, price & brand.
- A page contains of 50 items with possibility to move froward & back by this value.
- The app has filtering options by the name, the price & the brand.
- If there are repeting id's, only the first id is shown.
- If there is a fetch error, the error message is shown in the console and the reqest is repeated.
